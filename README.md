# Cerastes

> _Cerastes_ is a genus of small vipers, often hiding by burying themselves in the sand. These are ambush predators that lie buried in the sand, waiting for prey to pass by. -Wikipedia.

Cerastes is a compact, single-file HTML tool that obfuscates your code using XOR-based encryption at runtime. It takes your Unicode input, generates a random key matching its length, and encrypts the code byte by byte-producing a fully obfuscated output.

Alongside, Cerastes creates a lightweight JavaScript snippet that automatically decrypts the code at runtime and injects it into the DOM.

Like its namesakeâ€”the horned desert viper-Cerastes is small, stealthy, and strikes without being seen.
