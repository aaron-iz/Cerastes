# Cerastes

> _Cerastes_ is a genus of small vipers, often hiding by burying themselves in the sand. These are ambush predators that lie buried in the sand, waiting for prey to pass by. -Wikipedia.

Cerastes is a compact, single-file HTML tool that obfuscates your code using XOR-based encryption at runtime. It takes your Unicode input, generates a random key matching its length, and encrypts the code byte by byte-producing a fully obfuscated output.

Alongside, Cerastes creates a lightweight JavaScript snippet that automatically decrypts the code at runtime and injects it into the DOM.

Like its namesake-the horned desert viper-Cerastes is small, stealthy, and strikes without being seen.

## Example Output:

**For the following input**:
```javascript
alert("Boo! ðŸ‘»");
```

**The key generates randomly, so you'd get something like this**:
```javascript
const d=[87,89,85,71,71,24,88,46,25,95,71,75,149,229,226,218,70,31,77];
const k="650530zlv0fkezsad6v";
const s=document.createElement("script");
const y=d.map((v,i)=>String.fromCharCode(v^k.charCodeAt(i%k.length))).join("");
const z=new TextDecoder("utf-8").decode(Uint8Array.from(y,(c)=>c.charCodeAt(0)));
s.innerHTML=z;
document.body.appendChild(s);
```
